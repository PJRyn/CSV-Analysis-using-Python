# CSV Analysis
## About the Project
This project's goal was to use Python to provide data analysis on two CSV files, the first being PyBank where the goal was to output a text file including: 
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The other was PyPoll which provided analysis on another CSV file and it produced a text file that displayed:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

Included are both PyBank and PyPoll with the .csv files they analyse (located within Resources folders) and the Analysis_output.txt files (located within Analysis folders).
